### Web Penetration Test Report

#### Executive Summary

This report documents the findings of a web penetration test conducted on the OWASP Juice Shop application. The test was carried out in a controlled environment, and three critical vulnerabilities were identified, including SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

#### Test Details

- **Author**: John Doe
- **Testing Platform**: OWASP Juice Shop
- **Testing Tools Used**: Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP
- **Date of Test**: August 15, 2023

#### Findings

1. **SQL Injection**

   - **Description**: The application's login page was found to be vulnerable to SQL Injection, allowing unauthorized access to user accounts.
   - **Exploitation**: By inserting a malicious SQL query into the username field, authentication controls were bypassed.
   - **Impact**: Unauthorized access to user accounts and potentially sensitive data.
   - **Mitigation**: Parameterize SQL queries to prevent the execution of injected code.

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

   - **Description**: The comment section of the application was found to be vulnerable to stored XSS.
   - **Exploitation**: An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the comments that execute when viewed by other users.
   - **Impact**: Stealing of user sessions or delivering malicious payloads to users.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement proper input validation and sanitize user-generated content.

3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**

   - **Description**: Lack of CSRF protection was found in the user profile update function.
   - **Exploitation**: An attacker can trick users into performing actions without their consent.
   - **Impact**: Unauthorized actions carried out on behalf of authenticated users.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement anti-CSRF tokens and ensure proper authentication checks.

#### Recommendations

To enhance the security of the application, immediate attention should be given to patching the identified vulnerabilities. Implementing secure coding practices and periodic security testing can also help prevent future vulnerabilities.

#### Conclusion

This penetration test has provided valuable insights into the security posture of the OWASP Juice Shop application. By addressing the identified vulnerabilities and adopting a proactive security approach, the application can be made more resilient against potential attacks.
